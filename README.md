My CS50P- python Solutions - Introduction to Programming with Python [by Harvard &amp; edX] 


1. Introduction
Welcome to my repository for CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python. This repository contains my solutions to all the problem sets and final project required to complete the course and earn the certificate.

CS50P is a comprehensive online course offered by Harvard University, designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of programming using Python 3. The course is part of the larger CS50 series and is known for its challenging and engaging problem sets that build a strong foundation in computational thinking and practical programming skills.

2. Course Overview & Learning Outcomes
Throughout this course, I have developed a solid understanding of core programming concepts, including:

Fundamentals: Variables, data types, and functions.

Control Flow: Conditional statements (if, elif, else), loops (for, while).

Data Structures: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

Error Handling: Using try-except blocks to handle exceptions.

File I/O: Reading from and writing to files.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Creating and using classes and objects.

Code Organization: Writing modular and reusable code.

Libraries: Utilizing standard and third-party Python libraries.

Testing: Writing unit tests to ensure code correctness and functionality.

Advanced Topics: Regular expressions, command-line arguments, and virtual environments.

The course's problem-driven approach has been instrumental in solidifying these concepts and applying them to solve real-world problems.

3. Repository Structure
This repository is organized by week, mirroring the structure of the CS50P course. Each sub-directory corresponds to a specific week's problem set.

week0/: Includes problem sets for functions, variables, and basic I/O (e.g., indoor.py, playback.py, faces.py, einstein.py, tip.py).

week1/: Focuses on conditionals and logical operators (e.g., deep.py, bank.py, meal.py).

week2/: Covers loops and iterating through data (e.g., twttr.py, coke.py, camel.py, plates.py).

week3/: Dives into exceptions and error handling (e.g., grocery.py, taqueria.py, outdated.py).

week4/: Explores libraries and modules (e.g., emojize.py, figlet.py, bitcoin.py).

week5/: Focuses on unit testing with pytest (e.g., test_twttr.py, test_bank.py).

week6/: Introduces file I/O operations (e.g., scourgify.py, shirt.py, lines.py, pizza.py).

week7/: Covers regular expressions (e.g., um.py, watch.py, numb3rs.py, working.py).

week8/: Explores object-oriented programming (e.g., seasons.py, jar.py, cookie.py).

final_project/: Contains my final project, which demonstrates my accumulated knowledge to build a more substantial program. [Optional: Briefly describe your final project here. e.g., "The final project is a currency converter that fetches live exchange rates from an API." This adds a personal touch.]

4. Certificate of Completion
I have successfully completed all the course requirements and have been awarded a certificate of completion for CS50P. A copy of the certificate is available [link to where the certificate is stored, e.g., in a certificate/ folder within the repo or a link to a verifiable page].
